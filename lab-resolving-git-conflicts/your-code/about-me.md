* I am from the parisian suburbs, and I lived in Lyon for almost 10 years.
* I'm currently unemployed, but I used to teach people how to use computers (in university, public digital access spaces, and among social workers).
* I wrote a thesis about digital arts, particularly women in technologies and arts. I taught myself some basic python and html.


# Why am I here

* I'm here to learn data analytics, and bring a major change to my life and career.
* I expect to learn to code and use most of the tools a data analyst needs.

# What will I do after the bootcamp?

* I don't mind what type of industry I work in, as I can get passionate about any domain or subject.
* I would like to work for a firm whose etichal and professional values I agree with.
* I would enjoy working in a small-ish team.
* My long-term goal is to divide my time between working in a firm and teaching.
